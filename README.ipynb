    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This GitHub repository contains the code used for the analysis and plotting done in the paper titled \"Theta and alpha power across fast and slow timescales in cognitive control\" by Pieter Huycke, Pieter Verbeke, C. Nico Boehler and Tom Verguts. A preprint of this article is available on [BioRxiv.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.259341) The code available in this repository relies on the data collected for our study. This data is also open access, and can be found in this [Open Science Framework repository](https://osf.io/2q5eh/) when the article is published. "

    "    * Code\n",
    "        - The experiment code itself. Note that ```main (only sub-01).py``` is a version that was used for the first subject. This version was too long, and hence we used a shorter version for the other 29 subjects ```main.py```.\n",

    "- 3. Analysis\n",
    "    * Ordered list of the analyses associated with the results described in the paper. The scripts are ordered so that their order corresponds with the order of the results described in the manuscript. Comments refer to the specific analysis done\n",
    "- 4. Plots\n",
